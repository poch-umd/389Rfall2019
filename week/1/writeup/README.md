In this case providing my findings to my direct supervisor should be sufficient (timely, in a private office setting, and disclosed to no one else afterwards).  As an employee I would have to follow protocol and work with the organization's structure and chain of command.  The assigment (assigned to me by the direct supervisor) was specifically to audit the firmware for security issues, and that should be all what needs to be done.  There shouldn't be a need to "own" the issue and take it upon myself to pursue the matter further should the findings be ignored.

The counter-argument here is what if someone higher up ignores (or hides) the audit, and it results in catastrophic (fatal) accidents and an ensuing recall and legal trouble that costs the company billions of dollars in losses and expenses? (and irrepairably damages the company's reputation)  Would the responsibility fall on my shoulders? No, because in this case it would have been the company's failure, not mine (the individual employee). As an employee I performed responsibly within the confines of my assignment (no more, no less). The responsibility would've fallen on whoever (in the chain of command) chose to ignore the audit.

Following this scenario, what then if a government investigation discovers that I did not pursue the matter further knowing that the audit was ignored (and along with it the potential grave danger to the public)? Would I be to blame then? No, because as a company employee I am bound by its rules; and perhaps there was even some sort of non-disclosure agreement in force under my employee contract. And more importantly I did my part.

Following the scenario further, would the general public (especially the families whose loved ones were lost due to the security issue) hold me accountable for my inaction? No, because they themselves work for organizations and are held to corresponding rules as well, and would understand the position that I was in.

Another counter-argument is what about my own self consciousness? Wouldn't the loss of life (or at least the potential for it) weigh on my conscience? Well, yes and no. Yes, in that I could've sounded the alarm after the audit was ignored and the vulnerable ECUs were deployed anyway, and in doing so I could've prevented (potential) tragedies. And no, in that I was working as part of a team and I'm not solely to blame. Another vote for no goes to knowing that I simply can't be responsible for someone else's inaction (and irresponsibility). And another no as the risk was contingent; ie, it was not guaranteed. Perhaps at the time it wasn't even proven that the vulnerabilities could be discovered.

My position (at the moment at least), is that while ethical matters are an important consideration for an individual, there are practical and sensible limits to an individual's responsibility.
